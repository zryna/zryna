# Strict workspace contract

`zryna.workspace.json` is the authoritative repository registry. The JSON Schema improves editor feedback, but the Rust architecture engine remains authoritative because it also checks the real filesystem and Cargo dependency graph.

## Fail-closed policy

The check fails when it cannot prove correctness. It rejects:

- missing, invalid, or unknown contract fields;
- absolute paths, traversal, backslashes, duplicate roots, and case-insensitive collisions;
- unregistered root entries or Rust workspace members;
- immediate component entries not listed in that component's `allowedEntries` contract;
- missing component manifests, documentation, or canonical Rust entrypoints;
- adapter identities, protocol metadata, workers, or exact toolchain pins that drift from the contract;
- Cargo dependencies that differ from the registered direct dependency graph;
- forbidden dependency direction or cycles;
- symlinks and non-regular filesystem entries inside controlled components;
- incomplete scans caused by read errors or deterministic safety budgets.

Component paths use one host-independent identity before any operating-system lookup.
Applications are exactly `apps/<id>`, library members are exactly `crates/<id>`, and adapters are
exactly `adapters/<id>`. Path segments and controlled entry names are printable ASCII, use
case-insensitive identities, and reject normalized-away segments, Windows-reserved device stems,
reserved characters, trailing dots or spaces, and case-colliding siblings. The `apps`, `crates`,
and `adapters` containers may contain only their registered component directories.

The root `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `rust-toolchain.toml`, and `zryna.workspace.json` entries must
be regular files; `apps`, `crates`, and `adapters` must be real directories. Registered package
names, manifest locations, component ids, and Cargo workspace package ids must describe the same
physical roots.

There is no skip flag. Official build and release automation must run the same engine before any compiler phase.

Each member and adapter declares its allowed immediate files and directories. The scanner inspects an entry's metadata before excluding generated content. It excludes only these exact paths:

- root `.git`, which may be the regular file used by a Git worktree or a real directory;
- root `target` and root `node_modules`;
- each registered adapter's immediate `node_modules` directory;
- the declared `.zryna/cache` and `.zryna/out` directories.

An excluded directory must still be a real directory. A symlink, Windows reparse point, socket, FIFO, device, or other special file at an excluded path fails validation. Names such as nested `target`, `dist`, and nested unregistered `node_modules` remain controlled content; for example, `crates/example/src/target` is inspected normally. Unexpected content such as `.zryna/other` is also inspected instead of inheriting an output exemption.

## Bounded stable inspection

Every controlled regular file, including the workspace contract and component manifests, is read as UTF-8 through the same stable reader. The reader opens final file components without following links, compares safe file handles before reading, bounds the read, and compares the open handle and current path again after reading. Unix uses no-follow, non-blocking file opens. Windows opens reparse points themselves, rejects every reparse attribute, denies new write/delete sharing while the handle is held, and compares volume/file identifiers through safe file handles.

The production budgets are:

| Budget | Limit |
| --- | ---: |
| Workspace contract | 1 MiB |
| Cargo or adapter manifest | 1 MiB |
| Other controlled file | 2 MiB |
| Aggregate controlled bytes | 64 MiB |
| Filesystem entries | 50,000 |
| Directory depth | 32 |
| Registered members plus adapters | 256 |
| Validation diagnostics | 256, including the terminal budget diagnostic |
| Cargo metadata stdout | 16 MiB |
| Cargo metadata stderr | 64 KiB |
| Cargo metadata packages | 4,096 |
| Cargo metadata dependency edges | 65,536 |
| Cargo metadata execution | 30 seconds |

Entry traversal and later structural directory checks are sorted before diagnostics are selected. Exhausting any validation budget emits `ZRYNA-A1204`, halts all remaining traversal, and prevents later architecture validators from reading the incomplete workspace. A structural addition therefore requires a deliberate contract edit instead of becoming architecture by accident.

The implementation detects persistent links/reparse points, final-component replacement, and ordinary modification/replacement races. It is not an operating-system sandbox against a hostile process concurrently replacing an ancestor directory: Rust's standard filesystem API does not provide one portable atomic directory-handle walker. That stronger property requires a future capability-based, handle-relative walker on each supported operating system. Builds must therefore validate a workspace not being concurrently mutated by an untrusted process.

## Complete Cargo graph proof

After bounded filesystem inspection, the architecture engine invokes the pinned Cargo CLI directly
without a shell using metadata format version 1, all features, `--frozen`, and no platform filter.
The subprocess has concurrent bounded output readers, package and edge budgets, and a 30-second
deadline. The validator stops waiting at the same deadline even if a descendant retains an output
pipe. Network access and lockfile updates remain disabled. Root and member manifests, `Cargo.lock`,
`rust-toolchain.toml`, and both present and absent repository-local Cargo configuration paths are
recorded before the subprocess and compared again afterward.

The pinned command guarantee assumes a trusted build environment: `CARGO`, `PATH`, and rustup
selection variables must not be controlled by untrusted workspace content. Official CI pins Rust
1.97.1 before running the gate.

The engine combines both Cargo metadata views instead of trusting manifest key spelling:

- `workspace_members` and package ids prove the exact registered package set;
- every package dependency declaration covers aliases, inactive optional dependencies, normal,
  dev, build, and target-specific sections;
- `resolve.nodes[].deps[].pkg` proves the opaque package id reached after patches and resolution;
- every local package and local dependency path must match one registered physical member root.

The v1 contract stores component adjacency as target-id strings. One declared source-to-target edge
therefore authorizes that component relationship across all Cargo dependency kinds and target
predicates; every observed kind and target still contributes to the union graph. Adding an edge to
an undeclared component fails even when hidden behind an alias, dev/build section, optional feature,
target predicate, workspace inheritance, or source patch. Exact kind-specific authorization would
require a future structured-edge contract version and is not claimed by v1. Layer-direction and
cycle checks run over the observed Cargo union graph, not only the claimed JSON graph.

The executable-syntax phase graph is registered explicitly:

```text
zryna-source ───────────────┐
zryna-diagnostics ──────────┼→ zryna-syntax (foundation)

zryna-source ───────────────┐
zryna-diagnostics ──────────┼→ zryna-frontend (frontend)
zryna-syntax ───────────────┘

zryna-source ───────────────┐
zryna-diagnostics ──────────┼→ zryna-semantics (compiler)
zryna-syntax ───────────────┤
zryna-ir ───────────────────┤
zryna-abi ──────────────────┘

zryna-layout ───────────────┐
zryna-source ───────────────┴→ zryna-ownership-runtime-abi (compiler)
```

This graph lets providers construct untrusted DTOs while preventing semantic lowering from
depending on provider code. Compiler-to-frontend and backend-to-frontend edges are rejected by
the architecture validator. The ownership-runtime ABI authority remains in the compiler layer
because it consumes sealed compiler-owned layouts; the dependency-free scalar `zryna-abi`
foundation remains unchanged.

## Source-size and navigation policy

`pnpm structure:check` runs the read-only `scripts/check-repository-structure.mjs` checker before
other preflight commands and as a required M0 command on Linux and Windows. It supplements, never
replaces, `zryna-architecture`: component registration, Cargo membership, allowed paths, dependency
direction and complete filesystem safety remain that authority's obligations. No Rust module
regex is used or claimed to prove compilation, reachability, `cfg`, inline modules or `#[path]`.

All repository files ending in `.rs`, `.mjs`, `.js`, `.cjs`, `.ts`, `.sh`, `.ps1` or `.py`
(case-insensitively) default to production, including adapter and executable verification scripts.
Exact test, fixture and generated classifications live in `scripts/repository-structure-policy.json`
with an owner, reason and review reference. Directory names, generated comments and `.gitignore`
cannot exempt new source. Mixed production/test files remain production. Only real declared
dependency/build outputs (`.git`, root `target`/`node_modules`, adapter `node_modules`,
`.zryna/cache` and `.zryna/out`) are excluded from traversal. Source paths are portable and
case-unique; links, special files and stale current classification/exception paths reject.

Counting uses LF terminators: CRLF has the same count as LF, every blank/comment line counts,
empty content is zero lines, and a nonempty unterminated final line counts once. A lone CR is
content, not a terminator. New production source must be at most 500 lines. Sizes 350–500 warn
without failing. Existing production over 500 cannot exceed the smaller of its original inventory
count and trusted-base content count. After reaching 500 or fewer in the trusted base it uses the
ordinary ceiling. The immutable historical inventory records exact source paths/counts at
`885bb4d863ad112566add72fab6d2931587b71b1`, including separately classified test sources and a frozen
initial `production` eligibility bit; initial test records never grant grandfathering, even after
later reclassification. Before initial adoption the checker reproduces the complete inventory
from Git objects. Once an independently selected trusted base contains the policy, its anchor and
baseline must equal both the working policy and the original reachable policy adoption. This
preserves the reviewed inventory even when a squash merge omits the pre-adoption commit object;
it does not replace that identity or regenerate any allowance. Adoption source sizes can only
lower the frozen ceilings. Self-raised counts, eligibility changes and substituted anchors reject.

Local working trees, including linked Git worktrees, compare all current bytes (staged and
unstaged) to `HEAD`. To check a complete branch, set `ZRYNA_STRUCTURE_BASE` to a full trusted
ancestor commit SHA. CI must set that variable: PRs use the event's base SHA; main pushes use
the event's previous SHA. Full checkout history supplies comparison and policy-adoption history;
the initial anchor object is required only before a trusted policy has been adopted. The checker
never fetches. Missing, zero, ambiguous or unrelated authority fails with
an actionable error. During initial adoption only, when the trusted base predates the reviewed
anchor and has no policy, that named anchor establishes the initial ceiling. Later bases retain
the authenticated policy anchor as immutable provenance, without requiring that pre-squash
object to remain reachable. Shallow histories and multiple policy additions fail closed. Rename
tracking starts at the reachable adoption for adopted policies; an unrecognized pre-adoption
rename receives no inherited allowance. Reductions ratchet at accepted comparison revisions, not at
uncommitted intermediate editor states.

Git's deterministic 50%-similarity rename detection carries the old ceiling and trusted reduction
to a new path; classification and exception paths must be updated explicitly. Stage a rename so
Git can identify its destination. An unrecognized rename is treated as new production (500),
never given a larger allowance. Deleted source remains in the immutable historical inventory but
must leave no stale current policy entry or navigation link. Copying a large module does not
inherit its allowance.

Exceptions contain exactly `path`, `owner`, `reason`, numeric `ceiling` (>500), `review`, and
`expires` (`YYYY-MM-DD`). Expiry is exclusive at 00:00 UTC on that date. Invalid dates, duplicate
or wildcard paths, missing metadata, expired entries, and exceptions for absent, test-classified
or ordinary-sized files reject. Exceptions do not weaken architecture/compiler checks. Policy
edits are displayed in CI as requiring explicit maintainer review; successful parsing is not
human approval. Neither the checker nor CI regenerates allowances or modifies inputs.

The navigation check accepts the existing plain relative Markdown file-link grammar in
`CODE_NAVIGATION.md`; every declared target must resolve inside the repository without links.
It does not require a private-helper inventory or duplicate the component registry. The independent
`tests/repository-structure.test.mjs` suite covers count/ratchet/exception boundaries, renames,
deletion, worktrees, shallow history, unsafe paths, deterministic rejection and recovery.

## Compiler output transactions

The architecture scanner excludes only the declared real `.zryna/out` directory; that exclusion
does not authorize arbitrary output paths. Public `build` and `run` derive an output capability
for that exact directory and accept no caller-selected output root. They validate the portable
entrypoint and artifact stem, reject persistent links and Windows reparse points, and place all
selected output below one new sibling transaction directory. Unix sets the transaction and target
directories to mode `0700`. Windows inherits ACLs from the validated compiler-owned output root;
the workspace and `.zryna/out` must therefore already be private to the invoking principal.

The transaction synchronizes every artifact and `zryna-manifest-v1.json`, revalidates containment,
and performs one create-only same-filesystem directory rename to exactly
`.zryna/out/<stem>.build` or `.zryna/out/<stem>.run`. Only selected target subdirectories are
created. A final bundle exists only when it is complete; failure removes the known staged entries,
does not advertise a partial build, and never modifies a pre-existing destination. Build and run
bundles may share a stem because their final names are distinct. Cleanup that cannot be confirmed
is a separate fail-closed exit category. The create-only rename is the commit point; directory-
entry crash durability afterward is not claimed. The exact layout is specified in the
[CLI reference](CLI.md).

### Windows exact directory mutation

Windows transaction code that requires identity-stable directory commit or cleanup uses the
registered `zryna-windows-filesystem` foundation. A new owned directory is created relative to a
retained parent and returns an opaque `OwnedDirectory` in that same operation. Its authoritative
handle requests delete access, permits read and write sharing, and denies delete sharing; the
capability retains that handle, its current parent, and its current name through child operations,
audit, commit, rollback, and cleanup. A second capability reopen of that directory is expected to
fail while the delete-capable handle remains live and is never part of the lifecycle.

Commit renames that exact source handle relative to the retained destination parent with replacement
disabled. Cleanup consumes the opaque capability, marks that exact empty directory for deletion,
releases its authoritative handle, and uses the retained parent for a handle-relative no-reparse
open of the bound name. Cleanup succeeds only when Windows reports that name unambiguously absent;
a foreign replacement or a share-delete handle that keeps deletion pending returns an error. Neither
operation accepts an arbitrary source handle or path, reopens the source for mutation, or falls back
to an ambient path. Existing destinations, nonempty directories, unsafe component names, and sharing
conflicts fail closed; callers own stable diagnostic mapping and must preserve foreign content.

The repository structure gate enforces the exact exception component, copied lint defaults, sole
private-module `unsafe_code` allowance, and workspace forbid everywhere else. Compilation remains an
independent lint boundary, and explicit Windows CI exercises the native lifecycle.

## Controlled mutation

Future create and move commands will use a transactional planner:

1. derive the complete canonical change plan;
2. validate every target and ancestor;
3. refuse overwrites;
4. record expected hashes for edited files;
5. stage all writes;
6. commit atomically where the platform permits;
7. roll back on partial failure;
8. run the full architecture check again.

The future editor extension will display JSON diagnostics from this engine. It will not duplicate or redefine architecture rules.
