# Zryna native backend boundary

The object emitter accepts only `VerifiedMirModule` and the capability returned by exact target
selection. It uses `cranelift-codegen`, `cranelift-frontend`, `cranelift-module`, and
`cranelift-object` 0.135.1 with `target-lexicon` 0.13.5. Independent inspection uses `object`
0.39.0. All versions are exact workspace pins; no installed LLVM, compiler, assembler, or linker
is a dependency of this backend or object emission.

The only target is `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`: ELF64, little-endian, relocatable, baseline x86-64,
non-PIC, no optimization, no unwind output, and no per-function sections. Exported `i32`
functions use the System V AMD64 convention, external linkage, and the exact sealed
`zryna_v1_e_<logical>` symbol. The backend never constructs this mapping.

After encoding, the closed audit checks size, format, architecture, endianness, object kind,
nonzero global text symbols, exact declaration order, undefined symbols, and relocations. The
current pure leaf profile permits neither undefined symbols nor relocations. Only then is
`ValidatedNativeObjectArtifact` constructed. Stable codes distinguish unsupported target
(`ZRYNA-N3001`), code generation (`ZRYNA-N3002`), and object audit (`ZRYNA-N3003`).

Textual LLVM output remains a compatibility proof, not the object implementation. Driver-owned
linking and execution consume only the sealed object under a separate contract and do not expand
this backend boundary. Startup, calls, runtime helpers, FFI, Windows/macOS output, and Boolean
source/IR are outside this slice.

The separate internal M2 entrypoint consumes only the independently verified
`control_flow_v1::VerifiedProgram`. It declares every `zryna_m2_i_*` body locally, adds global
scalar-ABI wrappers only for entry exports, uses typed `i8` Boolean bodies with exact `i32` carrier
validation, and lowers the complete arithmetic, comparison, call, branch, jump, loop, and parallel
block-argument inventory.

Its distinct artifact binds audited bytes to the exact scalar ABI. The M2 audit admits only the
observed `R_X86_64_PLT32`/`X86Branch`/32-bit/addend-`-4` relocation at the expected caller and to
the exact verified local callee, one-for-one with the MIR call graph and wrapper inventory. See
[M2 Linux x86-64 native backend](../../docs/M2_NATIVE_BACKEND.md). This internal evidence does not
activate the public M2 CLI or alter the M1 emitter and hash.

## Internal DataOwnershipV1 boundary

The M3 path consumes only independently verified `DataOwnershipV1` native MIR. It lowers the
closed instruction inventory to deterministic, non-PIC Linux x86-64 ELF objects and admits only
the MIR's global program symbols, local per-type clone/drop helpers, exact runtime imports, and
relocations to those definitions or imports. Aggregate and owned values use verified Linux layout
records; scalar public exports remain `bool`/`i32` only. A checked one-million-unit preflight
accounts for functions, parameters, places, blocks, operations, cleanup actions, type members, and
expanded fixed arrays before Cranelift allocation; exact limit succeeds and the first extra reports
`ZRYNA-N3304`.

The driver compiles the repository-owned C11 ownership runtime with sealed flags and the validated
GNU toolchain. A second audit requires the exact 17 runtime definitions, the closed ambient
`malloc`/`free`/`memcpy`/`memset` import set, approved ELF sections, and symbol-bound relocations.
It then links that runtime object, one audited program object, and one typed invocation harness.
The completed ELF must be 64-bit little-endian x86-64, non-writable/executable, contain a nonzero
entrypoint, define the selected MIR function and every runtime symbol, and use only the sealed C
startup and result-channel imports. Object and executable publication are independently
create-only through the validated `.zryna/out` capability.

Verified exit cleanup is executable, not documentary: `Return` and explicit `Trap` run their exact
cleanup plan, while an unexpected Weak upgrade status releases its prepared result and runs the
same failure plan before trapping. Runtime-status traps are terminal process failures; the runtime
never publishes an output pointer or handle on a rejected allocation, growth, clone, concat,
reserve, or transition.

The named evidence is:

- `zryna-native-mir/tests/data_ownership_v1.rs` for exact MIR retention and hostile independent
  verification;
- `zryna-backend-native/tests/data_ownership_v1.rs` for deterministic object bytes, closed symbols
  and all semantically admitted repository fixtures;
- `ownership_runtime_v1::tests` for strict C, sanitizer execution, exact exports, hostile pointers,
  injected allocation failure, and atomic output state;
- `native::ownership::tests` for the fixed Pair oracle from published ELF files, deterministic
  relinking, typed execution, runtime allocation-ledger cleanup, hostile invocation/executable
  rejection, target rejection, and create-only collisions;
- the existing DataOwnershipV1 IR/semantic exact-limit and first-extra suites for type, function,
  block, edge, value, place, cleanup, borrow, and diagnostic budgets.

This remains an internal candidate capability. Public `--profile data-ownership-v1`, manifest v3,
multi-target transactions, non-Linux execution, dynamic libraries, general FFI, raw pointers,
custom linkers, performance claims, and three-target M3 conformance remain outside this boundary.
