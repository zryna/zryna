# WIT capability profiles v1

This document specifies the contract-only M4 foundation tracked by Issue #167. It assigns stable
WIT identities and bounded host-capability policies. It does not emit a component, generate a
binding, instantiate a runtime, add a CLI selector, or publish a supported profile.

## Normative artifacts and sources

The local package is `zryna:capability-profiles@0.1.0`; its source is
[`capability-profiles-v1/worlds.wit`](capability-profiles-v1/worlds.wit). The authoritative
machine-readable projection is
[`tests/wit-capability-profiles-v1.json`](../../tests/wit-capability-profiles-v1.json), validated
against [`schemas/zryna-wit-capability-profiles-v1.schema.json`](../../schemas/zryna-wit-capability-profiles-v1.schema.json).
Capability requests use
[`schemas/zryna-capability-request-v1.schema.json`](../../schemas/zryna-capability-request-v1.schema.json).

The WIT grammar is pinned to WebAssembly/component-model commit
[`2bed77e4228841c1d2721996d3ecc169ff96b158`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/2bed77e4228841c1d2721996d3ecc169ff96b158/design/mvp/WIT.md).
That specification makes a world the complete set of component imports and exports and gives
packages full semantic-version identities. WASI is pinned independently to release `v0.2.12`,
commit [`281ba75fafcd50961ef55f9e52747afcc9b71ede`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/tree/281ba75fafcd50961ef55f9e52747afcc9b71ede).
No unversioned or version-ranged WASI interface is admitted.

The repository validator recognizes and fail-closed parses the exact WIT subset used here:
one package declaration followed by flat worlds containing fully qualified interface imports and
exports. It is not a replacement for a general Component Model toolchain. A later emission gate
must additionally resolve the pinned upstream WIT dependency graph with its own parser.

## World identities

| Profile | Exact world | Host imports | Guest exports | Contract state |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| browser | `zryna:capability-profiles/browser@0.1.0` | 0 | 0 | specified only |
| command | `zryna:capability-profiles/command@0.1.0` | 13 | `wasi:cli/run@0.2.12` | specified only |
| server | `zryna:capability-profiles/server@0.1.0` | 4 | `wasi:http/incoming-handler@0.2.12` | specified only |

The empty browser world is deliberate. It records the capability-free identity without claiming
that today's core `wasm-web` artifact is a component. Omitting M4 profile selection preserves the
current import-free core-WebAssembly behavior exactly.

The command world lists each imported interface instead of including `wasi:cli/command`; this
makes every authority visible in the checked registry. The server world similarly selects the
HTTP handler interfaces and omits filesystem and environment interfaces. Standard I/O, terminal,
exit, and insecure-random interfaces are not in this contract.

## Denied-by-default selection

A profile is an upper bound, not an ambient grant. Before any future instantiation, a request must
name the exact profile and each requested capability. An omitted request list is empty. An omitted
capability is denied even if the selected profile permits it. An unknown profile, capability,
field, interface, or version fails before instantiation. There is no fallback to a broader world.

| Capability | Browser | Command | Server |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| clock | denied | granted | granted |
| environment | denied | granted | denied |
| filesystem | denied | granted | denied |
| network | denied | granted | granted |
| randomness | denied | granted | granted |

`granted` means only that the profile may satisfy the exact registry interfaces after the request
also names the capability. It does not select paths, endpoints, environment entries, entropy
sources, or clock policy. Those host-owned values must be supplied explicitly within the limits
below. Supplying an imported function that always rejects is not evidence that a forbidden
capability was granted.

The registry projection is exhaustive: each profile contains all five capability rows in the
canonical order `clock`, `environment`, `filesystem`, `network`, `randomness`. A denied row has no
interface and both limits are zero. A granted row has at least one exact interface and two
positive limits. The ordered union of granted interfaces must equal the world's WIT imports.

## Resource limits

Limits apply per component instance. A future host must reject a request before instantiation if
any declared maximum is exceeded; it must not truncate, wrap, partially grant, or silently replace
the request. Counts include resources retained by imported interfaces and their children.

| Capability | Metric | Browser | Command | Server |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| clock | simultaneous subscriptions / timers | 0 / 0 | 64 / 64 | 1,024 / 1,024 |
| environment | entries / total UTF-8 bytes | 0 / 0 | 128 / 65,536 | 0 / 0 |
| filesystem | preopens / open descriptors | 0 / 0 | 16 / 256 | 0 / 0 |
| network | allowed endpoints / concurrent operations | 0 / 0 | 64 / 128 | 128 / 1,024 |
| randomness | bytes per call / bytes per instance | 0 / 0 | 65,536 / 8,388,608 | 65,536 / 8,388,608 |

An endpoint is one normalized host-and-port policy entry. A network operation includes an open
socket, DNS lookup, or HTTP request retained by the host. Environment byte accounting is the sum
of UTF-8 key and value bytes; duplicate keys are invalid rather than counted twice. A preopen is
one host-selected directory authority, not a guest path pattern. A descriptor or child resource
must be released before its slot can be reused. Clock and randomness values remain
nondeterministic host inputs; deterministic compilation and registry validation do not promise
deterministic runtime values.

The WIT source itself is limited to 16,384 UTF-8 bytes, three worlds, five capability rows per
profile, seven interfaces per capability, and thirteen imports per world. The validator accepts
the exact boundary and rejects the first extra unit.

## Versioning and compatibility

There are three independent identities:

1. registry schema `zryna.wit-capability-profiles.v1` controls JSON shape and validation;
2. WIT package `zryna:capability-profiles@0.1.0` controls world/interface identity; and
3. WASI `0.2.12` controls every external interface identity.

Consumers must match all three exactly. A comment or documentation-only clarification may leave
them unchanged. Any world import/export change, new capability, weakened denial, larger resource
limit, different WASI release, or changed request outcome requires a reviewed registry/schema
revision and a new WIT package version. Removing or changing an existing world requires a new
incompatible identity; no subtyping claim is inferred from WIT `include`. Because the local
package is pre-1.0 and specified-only, no public compatibility or support promise exists yet.

A later implementation may add a new registry version while retaining this file as historical
evidence. It must not rewrite a released registry or reinterpret a v1 denial as a grant.

## Validation and diagnostics

[`scripts/wit-capabilities/validate.mjs`](../../scripts/wit-capabilities/validate.mjs) verifies the
schemas, source digest, exact package/world identities, WIT import/export projection, exhaustive
capability rows, default denials, limits, and deterministic request outcomes.

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `ZRYNA-C4000` | malformed schema, WIT, identity, version, ordering, or registry projection |
| `ZRYNA-C4001` | requested or encoded capability is denied |
| `ZRYNA-C4002` | usage does not belong to the named requested capability |
| `ZRYNA-C4003` | request exceeds a profile resource limit |
| `ZRYNA-C4004` | WIT or registry structural bound is exceeded |

Committed fixtures cover a capability-free browser request, exact-limit command and server grants,
browser filesystem denial, server environment denial, an unknown capability, unrequested usage,
and the first environment entry beyond the command limit. Tests also synthesize every one of the
fifteen profile/capability decisions, malformed WIT and registry mutations, deterministic replay,
and exact/first-extra WIT byte boundaries.

## Dependency and rollout boundaries

Issue #357 owns cross-target and transitive dependency capability composition. Issue #359 owns
JS/WASM value conversion and resource adapters. Issue #168 owns package and release formats.
This contract supplies identities and host-policy inputs to those tasks but implements none of
their behavior.

Component emission, host bindings, runtime enforcement, CLI activation, examples, publication,
and a public profile require separate implementation, conformance, and activation gates. Existing
M0–M3 source, IR, backend, manifest, CI, and authenticated inventory contracts are unchanged.
